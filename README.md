## Description

Based on Week 4 Example 4 code, this project adds a new level using the levels.json file (level 3) and introduces an obstacle (e.g. polluted water) to the game. The game environment and player have also been stylized into an ocean/fish theme.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

Player moves their fish character around using the WASD/arrow keys to reach the food pellet. Once reached, the player moves onto a new level/map, where there is an increased difficulty due to the amount of obstacles and area to move around.

If the player reaches an obstacle, a red warning message will be shown temporarily, and the fish is brought back to the start of the level. After successfully completing all 3 levels, the player is brought to an end screen (success.js) and can restart by pressing the button.
