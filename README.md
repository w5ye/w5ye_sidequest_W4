## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 4: layable Maze (JSON + Level class + Player class)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han

---

## Description

Based on example 3, creates and positions the player using preloads and loadJSON files.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets
